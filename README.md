###### National Museum, New Delhi

National Museum is a **multidisciplinary** which has collection from various regulations such as history, arts, etc. I went there with three of my friends which accompanied me during the  tour. Museums are very significant in terms of knowing the socio-cultural, religious and political history of one place.

The National Museum in New Delhi is also known as **National Museum of India**.
